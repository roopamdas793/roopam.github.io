# Introduction

This presentation explains why Git, GitHub and R work effectively when combined in software development and analytical workflows. These tools integrate into a structured, collaborative, and reproducible system. Git is a version manager, GitHub supports collaboration and accessibility, and R is a powerful statistical and data-analysis environment. Together, they support documentation, clarity in decision-making, and efficient project flow.
